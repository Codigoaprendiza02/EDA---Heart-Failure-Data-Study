# Heart Failure Clinical Dataset – Basic EDA

## Project Overview
This project performs a **very basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The aim is to understand the dataset structure, explore simple patterns, and identify factors related to heart failure outcomes.
